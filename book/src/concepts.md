# Some D-Bus concepts to help newcomers

## Bus

A D-Bus "bus" is a kind of server that handles several connections in a
bus-topology fashion. As such, it relays messages between connected endpoints,
and allows to discover endpoints or sending broadcast messages (signals).

Typically, a Linux system has a system bus, and a session bus. The latter is
per-user. It is also possible to have private buses or no bus at all (i-e direct
peer-to-peer communication instead).

## Bus name / service name

An endpoint can have various names, which allows to address messages to it on
the bus. All endpoints are assigned a unique name by the bus at start. Since this name is not
static, most services use something called a *well-known bus name* and typically it's this name,
that you'll be concerned with.

An example would be the [FreeDesktop Notifications Service] that uses
`org.freedesktop.Notifications` as its well-known bus name.

For further details on bus names, please refer to the [Bus names chapter] of the D-Bus specification.

## Object path

It is quite typical for a service to expose a single object path, such as
`/org/freedesktop/Notifications`, and you may not have to care much about this
concept after all.

But it is worth to understand that D-Bus organizes the interfaces by object
paths, which roughly should match instances of various objects in the process,
organized in a tree fashion.

## Interfaces

A D-Bus interface can have methods, properties and signals. The XML description
of an interface is mostly a machine-level detail. zbus macros will handle the
introspection of your interfaces for you. In the next chapters, we will see how
to translate an introspection XML to a Rust proxy.

## Good practices & API design

It is recommended to organise the service name, object paths and interface name
by using fully-qualified domain names, in order to avoid potential conflicts.

Please read the [D-Bus API Design Guidelines] carefully for other
similar considerations.

## ðŸ’¡ Not yet async!

We are working on improving zbus in various aspects. One of them is making zbus
asynchronous, so read/write operations will not be potentially blocking your
thread. Note that usually D-Bus messages are fairly small, and shouldn't block.
Nevertheless, this is high in our priority list.
