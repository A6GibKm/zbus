# Some D-Bus concepts to help newcomers

## Bus

A D-Bus "bus" is a kind of server that handles several connections in a
bus-topology fashion. As such, it relays messages between connected endpoints,
and allows to discover endpoints or sending broadcast messages (signals).

Typically, a Linux system has a system bus, and a session bus. The latter is
per-user. It is also possible to have private buses or no bus at all (i-e direct
peer-to-peer communication instead).

## Bus name / service name

An endpoint can have various names, which allows to address messages to it on
the bus. All endpoints are assigned a unique name by the bus at start. Since this name is not
static, most services use something called a *well-known bus name* and typically it's this name,
that you'll be concerned with.

An example would be the [FreeDesktop Notifications Service] that uses
`org.freedesktop.Notifications` as its well-known bus name.

For further details on bus names, please refer to the [Bus names chapter] of the D-Bus specification.

## Objects and Object paths

An object is akin to the concept of an object or an instance in many programming languages. All
services expose at least one object on the bus and all clients interact with the service through
these objects. These objects can be ephemeral or they could live as long as the service itself.

Every object is identified by a string, which is referred to as its path. An example of an object
path is `/org/freedesktop/Notifications`, which identies the only object exposed by the
[FreeDesktop Notifications Service].

For further details on object paths, please refer to the [Basic types chapter] of the D-Bus
specification.

## Interfaces

A D-Bus interface can have methods, properties and signals. The XML description
of an interface is mostly a machine-level detail. zbus macros will handle the
introspection of your interfaces for you. In the next chapters, we will see how
to translate an introspection XML to a Rust proxy.

## Good practices & API design

It is recommended to organise the service name, object paths and interface name
by using fully-qualified domain names, in order to avoid potential conflicts.

Please read the [D-Bus API Design Guidelines] carefully for other
similar considerations.

## ðŸ’¡ Not yet async!

We are working on improving zbus in various aspects. One of them is making zbus
asynchronous, so read/write operations will not be potentially blocking your
thread. Note that usually D-Bus messages are fairly small, and shouldn't block.
Nevertheless, this is high in our priority list.
